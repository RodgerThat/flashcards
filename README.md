## Flashcards

A WordPress theme as a simple WebApp.
It generates responsive flash cards for the kiddles to work on their sight words.
I wanted to get better at #ajax in wordpress and #dynamic #flexslider integration.
and i've never made a raw wordpress theme.
So this seemed like a simple project for such a thing.

## Installation

It's a WordPress Theme, zip and upload via Appearance -> Themes -> Add New Theme, then activate.
OR copy files into /wp-content/themes/flashcards/ and then activate.

## Tests
Kinda.
